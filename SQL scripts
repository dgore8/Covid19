# Data Cleaning and Preparation

## Table Creation

- **covid_19_india Table**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE covid_19_india (
      Sno SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      Date DATE NOT NULL,
      Time TIME NOT NULL,
      State TEXT,
      ConfirmedIndianNational INT,
      ConfirmedForeignNational INT,
      Cured INT,
      Deaths INT,
      Confirmed INT
  );
covid_vaccine_statewise Table:
CREATE TABLE covid_vaccine_statewise (
    Updated_On DATE NOT NULL,
    State TEXT,
    Total_Doses_Administered INT,
    Sessions INT,
    Sites INT,
    First_Dose_Administered INT,
    Second_Dose_Administered INT,
    Male_Doses_Administered INT,
    Female_Doses_Administered INT,
    Transgender_Doses_Administered INT,
    Covaxin_Doses_Administered INT,
    CoviShield_Doses_Administered INT,
    Sputnik_V_Doses_Administered INT,
    AEFI INT,
    AgeGroup_18_44_Doses_Administered INT,
    AgeGroup_45_60_Doses_Administered INT,
    AgeGroup_60plus_Doses_Administered INT,
    AgeGroup_18_44_Individuals_Vaccinated INT,
    AgeGroup_45_60_Individuals_Vaccinated INT,
    AgeGroup_60plus_Individuals_Vaccinated INT,
    Male_Individuals_Vaccinated INT,
    Female_Individuals_Vaccinated INT,
    Transgender_Individuals_Vaccinated INT,
    Total_Individuals_Vaccinated INT
);
StatewiseTestingDetails Table:
CREATE TABLE StatewiseTestingDetails (
    Date DATE NOT NULL,
    State TEXT,
    TotalSamples INT,
    Negative INT,
    Positive INT
);

# Null Value Handling
To handle NULL values in integer columns for the covid_vaccine_statewise and StatewiseTestingDetails tables, the following SQL UPDATE queries were executed:

UPDATE covid_vaccine_statewise
SET
    Total_Doses_Administered = COALESCE(Total_Doses_Administered, 0),
    Sessions = COALESCE(Sessions, 0),
    Sites = COALESCE(Sites, 0),
    First_Dose_Administered = COALESCE(First_Dose_Administered, 0),
    Second_Dose_Administered = COALESCE(Second_Dose_Administered, 0),
    Male_Doses_Administered = COALESCE(Male_Doses_Administered, 0),
    Female_Doses_Administered = COALESCE(Female_Doses_Administered, 0),
    Transgender_Doses_Administered = COALESCE(Transgender_Doses_Administered, 0),
    Covaxin_Doses_Administered = COALESCE(Covaxin_Doses_Administered, 0),
    CoviShield_Doses_Administered = COALESCE(CoviShield_Doses_Administered, 0),
    Sputnik_V_Doses_Administered = COALESCE(Sputnik_V_Doses_Administered, 0),
    AEFI = COALESCE(AEFI, 0),
    AgeGroup_18_44_Doses_Administered = COALESCE(AgeGroup_18_44_Doses_Administered, 0),
    AgeGroup_45_60_Doses_Administered = COALESCE(AgeGroup_45_60_Doses_Administered, 0),
    AgeGroup_60plus_Doses_Administered = COALESCE(AgeGroup_60plus_Doses_Administered, 0),
    AgeGroup_18_44_Individuals_Vaccinated = COALESCE(AgeGroup_18_44_Individuals_Vaccinated, 0),
    AgeGroup_45_60_Individuals_Vaccinated = COALESCE(AgeGroup_45_60_Individuals_Vaccinated, 0),
    AgeGroup_60plus_Individuals_Vaccinated = COALESCE(AgeGroup_60plus_Individuals_Vaccinated, 0),
    Male_Individuals_Vaccinated = COALESCE(Male_Individuals_Vaccinated, 0),
    Female_Individuals_Vaccinated = COALESCE(Female_Individuals_Vaccinated, 0),
    Transgender_Individuals_Vaccinated = COALESCE(Transgender_Individuals_Vaccinated, 0),
    Total_Individuals_Vaccinated = COALESCE(Total_Individuals_Vaccinated, 0);

# For table  StatewiseTestingDetails
UPDATE StatewiseTestingDetails
SET
    TotalSamples = COALESCE(TotalSamples, 0),
    Negative = COALESCE(Negative, 0),
    Positive = COALESCE(Positive, 0);

# Duplicate Record Removal
Duplicate records were identified in the StatewiseTestingDetails table and removed using the following SQL query:

SELECT date, state, totalsamples, negative, positive
FROM StatewiseTestingDetails
GROUP BY date, state, totalsamples, negative, positive
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

So to remove records :

DELETE FROM statewisetestingdetails
WHERE (date, state, totalsamples, negative, positive) IN (
SELECT date, state, totalsamples, negative, positive 
FROM statewisetestingdetails
GROUP BY date, state, totalsamples, negative, positive
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1); #Two rows were same as they were duplicate

## Data Cleaning Documentation: 
For the tables, data cleaning was conducted. Duplicate records were identified based on multiple columns, and the DELETE query was used to remove them. Additionally, NULL values were replaced with 0 in columns where appropriate. The data format was validated, ensuring consistency and correctness across the dataset.
