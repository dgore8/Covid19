# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for our COVID19 Dataset
•	What is the total number of COVID19 cases (confirmed and deaths) reported for the entire dataset?

SELECT  SUM(Confirmed) AS TotalConfirmed,
SUM(Deaths) AS TotalDeaths
FROM   covid_19_india;

•	How many unique states are included in the COVID19 cases dataset, and what are their names?

SELECT DISTINCT State AS UniqueStateCount
FROM (   SELECT State FROM covid_19_india
UNION
SELECT State FROM covid_vaccine_statewise
UNION
SELECT State FROM StatewiseTestingDetails
) AS CombinedStates;

•	Calculate the total number of vaccine doses administered across all states.

SELECT State,
SUM(Total_Doses_Administered) AS TotalDosesAdministered
FROM covid_vaccine_statewise
GROUP BY State;

•	What is the percentage of individuals vaccinated in the age group 60 and above, on average, across all states? We use case because some rows has 0 in Total_Individuals_Vaccinated

SELECT Round (AVG(
CASE
WHEN Total_Individuals_Vaccinated > 0 THEN AgeGroup_60plus_Individuals_Vaccinated * 100.0 / Total_Individuals_Vaccinated
ELSE 0.0   Set to 0% if Total_Individuals_Vaccinated is 0
END ),2 ) AS AveragePercentageVaccinated
FROM covid_vaccine_statewise;


•	What is the total number of vaccine doses administered in each state according to the covid_vaccine_statewise table, and how does this distribution vary across different states?

SELECT SUM(Total_Doses_Administered) AS TotalVaccineDoses,
State FROM
covid_vaccine_statewise
GROUP BY State;

•	Calculate and visualize the distribution of vaccination sessions across states. Are there any outliers or unusual patterns?

SELECT State,
sum(Sessions) AS VaccinationSessions
FROM covid_vaccine_statewise
group by state ;

•	Determine the state with the highest and lowest vaccine coverage in terms of the percentage of individuals vaccinated in the age group 1844.

WITH VaccinePercentages AS (
SELECT State, ROUND(
SUM(AgeGroup_18_44_Individuals_Vaccinated) * 100.0 /
SUM(Total_Individuals_Vaccinated)
) AS PercentageVaccinated_18_44 FROM
covid_vaccine_statewise
GROUP BY State )
SELECT State, PercentageVaccinated_18_44
FROM ( SELECT State, PercentageVaccinated_18_44,
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY PercentageVaccinated_18_44 DESC) AS HighRank,
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY PercentageVaccinated_18_44 ASC) AS LowRank
FROM VaccinePercentages ) AS RankedPercentages
WHERE HighRank = 1 OR LowRank = 1;


•	Calculate the case fatality rate (CFR) for each state. How does it vary across states, and has it changed over time?

SELECT State, SUM(CFR) AS TotalCFR
FROM ( SELECT State, Date, (Deaths * 100.0 / Confirmed) AS CFR
FROM covid_19_india
WHERE Deaths IS NOT NULL
AND Confirmed > 0 ) AS CFRData
GROUP BY State
ORDER BY State;

•	Investigate the impact of gender on vaccination rates. Are there significant differences between male, female, and transgender individuals' vaccination rates?

SELECT 'Male' AS Gender,
SUM(Male_Individuals_Vaccinated) AS TotalVaccinated,
SUM(Male_Individuals_Vaccinated) * 100.0 / SUM(Total_Individuals_Vaccinated) AS VaccinationRate
FROM covid_vaccine_statewise
UNION
SELECT 'Female' AS Gender,
SUM(Female_Individuals_Vaccinated) AS TotalVaccinated,
SUM(Female_Individuals_Vaccinated) * 100.0 / SUM(Total_Individuals_Vaccinated) AS VaccinationRate FROM covid_vaccine_statewise
UNION
SELECT 'Transgender' AS Gender,
SUM(Transgender_Individuals_Vaccinated) AS TotalVaccinated,
SUM(Transgender_Individuals_Vaccinated) * 100.0 / SUM(Total_Individuals_Vaccinated) AS VaccinationRate FROM covid_vaccine_statewise;
